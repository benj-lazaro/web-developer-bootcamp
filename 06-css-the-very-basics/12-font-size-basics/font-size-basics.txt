Font Size Basics With Pixels 
----------------------------
- CSS property "font-size" sets the size of the font
    - It accepts a number representing the size of the font
    
    - The assigned value is expressed in various units
        - e.g. named values, "em", "ex", "px", etc.

    - These units are divided into two (2) groups
        - Absolute
            - It is NOT dependent on parent element's font size
            - It will ALWAYS be the same size in the HTML document
                - e.g. "px", "pt", "cm", "in", "mm"

        - Relative
            - e.g. "em", "rem", "vh", "vw", "%" and more
    
    - Reference (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-size)


- The unit "px" is the MOST commonly used Absolute unit
    - It is a static value  
        - A good choice if pixel accuracy is required

        - An OS independent and cross-browser way of literally telling the browser
            - To render the letters at exactly the number of pixels in height that have been specified

        - However, "1px" does NOT mean that the width of a letter is exactly 1 pixel

    - This unit is NOT RECOMMENDED for responsive websites
