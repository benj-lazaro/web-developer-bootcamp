CSS is Huge, Don't Panic
------------------------
- CSS has TONS of properties that can be used at any point
    - NO need to know them ALL at once
    
    - Compared to HTML
        - There is a lot more to know
            - None of it is complicated

    - CSS properties that are often used
        - Will naturally easy to remember
        
        - Those that are NOT, just look them up
            - Reference (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference)

        - Those properties whose name can NOT be remembered
            - Just Google it
            - NOTE: There is NO shame in researching it on Google

    - Just focus on:
        - The syntax / patterns
        - Being able to access information online when you need it
            - NOT craming everything in your head at once
