A Reminder On Semicolons & CSS
------------------------------
- In CSS
    - A semicolon at the end of every property declaration is ESSENTIAL
    
    - Leaving it off
        - The browser will NOT generate an error message
            - The style will simply NOT be IMPLEMENTED

        - This is a common source of a style NOT being rendered on the browser

    - NOTE: When VS Code as a code editor
        - It will highlight and report that a semicolon is missing
