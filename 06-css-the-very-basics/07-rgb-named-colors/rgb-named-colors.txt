Color Systems: RGB and Named Colors
-----------------------------------
- The Named color is a CSS data type that 
    - Refers to the literal name of a color

    - This is the easiest color system to get started with 
        - But also the most limited set
            - It references 140 named colors
            - Reference (https://htmlcolorcodes.com/color-names/)

        - Modern-day computer monitors can display 16+ million colors 

    - Reference (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/named-color)
    

- RGB is a color model / system that represents colors 
    - As a mixture of Red, Green & Blue channels
    
    - Each channel in the browser ranges from 0 to 255
        - 0 = meaning off

    - Reference (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/RGB)

    - It is an example of additive color system that
        - Mix Red, Green & Blue together in order to make different colors

    - Write the value of each channel in order
        - Starting with Red, then Green and ends with Blue (i.e. RGB)

    - These values are NOT needed to be memorized
        - Online and downloadable color pickers can help with the task
