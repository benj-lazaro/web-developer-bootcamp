Including Styles Correctly
--------------------------
- Methods of including styles using CSS in a HTML document

- Inline Styles (Inline CSS)
    - Defining styles directly inline on EACH HTML element 
        - Using the global attribute "style"
        - Reference (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/style)

    - It is IMPOSSIBLE to share styles between HTML documents
    
    - It is NOT RECOMMENDED


- The <style> element (Intenral CSS)
    - Writing styles NOT directly inline on EACH HTML element
    
    - Instead using a <style> element on a EACH HTML document
        - Located within the <head> element
        - Reference (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/style)

    - Write the CSS rule(s) as content
        - Allows multiple HTML elements to share the same style
        - It does NOT allow sharing styles between multiple HTML documents
    
    - It is NOT RECOMMENDED
        

- External Stylesheet (External CSS)
    - Writing styles in an external and separate stylesheet (.css) file then
        - In each HTML document, use the <link> element to include the .css file
        - Reference (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/link)

    - Benefit of this approach is:
        - Allows to share styles between multiple HTML documents
        - NO need to duplicate the CSS rules from one HTML document to another

    - It is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
