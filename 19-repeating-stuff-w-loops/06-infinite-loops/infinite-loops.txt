The Perils Of Infinite Loops
----------------------------
- An infite loop is a loop that does NOT STOP
    - It runs continuously until the browser & JavaScript runs out of memory
    - Sometimes locks up or unexpectedly force quit (crashes) the browser application


- To prevent an infite loop
    - When writing any loop, pay attention to how the loop will stop
    - Will the loop meet the condition that eventually terminates the loop

        for (let i = 20; i >= 0; i++) {  // The given condition will NEVER be met
            console.log(i);
        }
