Another Loop: The while Loop
----------------------------
- The "while" loop continue to run
    - As long as the test condition evaluates to "true"
        - The condition is evaluated BEFORE executing the statement(s)
    
    - Reference (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/while)

    - NOTE: It is very easy to create an infinite loop
        - Make sure that the condition will EVENTUALLY evaluates to "false"
            - e.g. placing the iterator within the loop's code block

        - Otherwise the "while" loop PERPETUALLY executes


- Use case
    - A "for" loop is preferred for tasks that
        - Come with a set number of iterations

    - A "while" loop is prefered for tasks that
        - Executes statement(s) as long as the condition evaluates to true
        - NOT based on a set of iterations
    

Syntax:

while (<test_condition>) {
  <statement>;
  ...
}
