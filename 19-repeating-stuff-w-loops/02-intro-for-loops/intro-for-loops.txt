Intro To for Loops
------------------
- The purpose of a loop is to repeat some functionality
    - JavaScript has several types of loops
        - for
        - while
        - for of
        - for in


- The "for" statement creates a loop that consists of
    - Three (3) optional expressions
        - Initial Expression
        - Condition (boolean expression)
        - Increment Expression 

    - Enclosed in parenthesis
    - Separated by semicolons
    - Followed by statement(s) to be executed within the loop

    - Reference (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for)


Syntax:

for (<initialExpression>; <condition>; <incrementExpression>) {
  <statement>
  ...
}
