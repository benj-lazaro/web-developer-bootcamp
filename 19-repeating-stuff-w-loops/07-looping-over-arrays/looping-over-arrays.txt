Looping Over Arrays
-------------------
- To loop over (i.e. iterate) an array using a "for" loop
    - Start at index 0
    - Continue looping until the last index (i.e. length - 1)


- To reverse iterate an array using a "for" loop
    - Start at the highest index (i.e. length - 1)
    - Continue looping (in reverse) until the first index
