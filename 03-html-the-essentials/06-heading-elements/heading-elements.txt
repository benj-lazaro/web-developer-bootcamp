Heading Elements

- The <h1> to <h6> elements represents six (6) levels of section headings
    - They exists to add structure to the HTML document
        - To indicate the main and subsequent sub-topics
            - <h1> is the highest
            - <h6> is the lowest

    - Do NOT use the Heading Elements for 
        - The font size of the text they generate
        - The sizes can be changed after the fact using CSS (Cascading Style Sheet)

    - IMPORTANT: There should ONLY be ONE <h1> at most, in a HTML document
        - It should ALWAYS represent the top-level main heading


    - NOTE: Heading elements are block-level elements
        - It forces everything that comes after it to start on a separate line
