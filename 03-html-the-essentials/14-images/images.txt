Images
------
- The <img> element is a "self-closing tag "that embeds an image into the HTML document
    - The attribute "src" is REQUIRED
        - Contains the path to the image

    - The attribute "alt" holds a textual replacement
        - It is mandatory

        - Incredibly useful for accessibility
            - Screen readers reads the attribute's value
            - The value is displayed if the image can NOT be loaded
                - e.g. network problems, unsupported image type

    - The size of the image can be changed in HTML
        - Although this is considered BAD PRACTICE
        - It is better to use CSS

Syntax:
