Paragraph Elements
------------------
- The <p> element represents a paragraph
    - It is NOT necessarily a paragraph of text
        - It is on most cases

    - It can contain any sort of related content grouped together
        - e.g. form, images, etc.
        
    - NOTE: Paragraphs are block-level elements
        - It forces everything that comes after it to start on a separate line

    - Reference (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/p)
    

Syntax:

    <p><content_here></p>

    <p>
        <content_here>
    </p>
