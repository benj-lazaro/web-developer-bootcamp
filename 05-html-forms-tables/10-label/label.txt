The All-Important Label
-----------------------
- The <label> element represents a caption for an item in a user interface
    - It is a inline element

    - They are important in terms of accessibility
        - Making HTML forms easier to use
    
    - Associating a <label> with a form control (e.g. <input>) offer some major advantages
        - The label text is programmatically associated with a text input
    
        - When a user clicks a label
            - The browser passes the focus to its associated <input> element

    - The <label> element utilizes two attributes "id" and "for"
        - The global attribute "id" defines a UNIQUE IDENTIFIER for the <input> element

        - The attribute "for" when used on a <label> element
            - It indicates the form element (e.g. <input>) that this label describes
