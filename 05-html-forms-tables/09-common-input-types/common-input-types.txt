Common Input Types
------------------
- The <input> element is self-closing tag that is used to create interactive controls
    - For web-based forms in order to accept adata from the user

    - A wide variety of types of input data & control widgets are available
        - Depending on the device and user-agent (i.e. a computer program representing a person)

        - Ranging from date pickers to checkboxes

    - It is one of the most powerful and complex in all of HTML
        - Due to its sheer number of combinations of input types & attributes

    - The attribute "type" is where the magic happens
        - Changing the assigned value alters the behavior & appearance of the <input> element

    - Reference (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input)


- The attribute "placeholder" defines the text displayed in a form control
    - When the control has NO value

    - It should provide a brief hint to the user
        - As to what the expected type of data that should be entered into the control
    
    - NOTE: It does NOT work for EVERY form control
