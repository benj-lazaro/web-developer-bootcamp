Introducing HTML Tables
-----------------------
- Tables are structured set of data
    - Made up of columns & rows
        - They can be a great way of displaying data clearly

    - In the early days (from the 90s up to the early 2000s)
        - Tables were used to create page layouts

    - Today and with the modern web
        - Tables are ONLY used for creating an actual data table
