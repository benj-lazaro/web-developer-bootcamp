HTML Buttons
------------
- The <button> element is an interactive element activated by a user with
    - A mouse, keyboard, finger, voice command or other assistive technology

    - Once activated, it then performs an action

    - By default, HTML buttons are presented in a style resembling
        - The platform the user agent runs on
        - Their appearance can be changed using CSS

    - The text placed in-between the opening & closing tags
        - Serves as a label to the <button> element

    - Reference (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/button)


- A <button> element INSIDE a <form> element
    - It has a default behavior of submitting the HTML form data
        - To the server (value) assigned on the <form> element's attribute "action"


- A <button> element OUTSIDE a <form> element
    - By default, it does NOTHING
    

- Using the attribute "type" changes the behavior of the <button> element
    - The value "button"
        - It does NOT submit form data to a server
        - Even if the <button> element is inside a <form> element

    - The value "submit" (optional)
        - It performs the default behavior
        - Submitting the form data to the server
        
    - The value "reset"
        - Resets all controls to their initial values


- Alternatively, an <input> element can used to behave like a <button> element
    - Use the attribute "type"
        - Assign the value "submit"
    
    - To label the button
        - Assign the label using the attribute "value"
