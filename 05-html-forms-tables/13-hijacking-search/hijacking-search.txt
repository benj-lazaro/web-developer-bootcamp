"Hijacking" Google & Reddit's Search
------------------------------------
- A fun little demo
    - Build a search form for Reddit, Google & YouTube
    
    - To send form data to their servers
        - From your form
        - Then end up getting a search page

    - Taking advantage of the <form> element's attribute "action"
        - Following the correct pattern (i.e. attribute "name" value)
            - Using the correct value in the attribute "name"
            - For the corresponding site's search query
