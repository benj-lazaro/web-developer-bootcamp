HTML Form Validation
--------------------
- The term "validation" refers to
    - Adding constraints or validation user input or data
        - e.g. Some field can NOT be empty, password requiring 20 characters, etc.

    - This section focuses on
        - Browser built-in (or client-side) validations that can be added into HTML forms


- The HTML attribute "required"
    - The boolean attribute IF PRESENT in an <input> element
        - Indicates that the user MUST specify a value for the input
            - BEFORE the HTML form can be submitted

    - Returns the message "Please fill out this field"
        - When providing a blank (or nothing) on said field
        - Prevents the HTML from being submitted
        - NOTE: Message may vary on the browser being used

- The HTML attribute "minlength"
    - Defines the minimum string length that
        - The user can enter into an <input> or <textarea> element

    - It MUST have an integer value of 0 or higher

    - Reference (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/minlength)


- The HTML attribute "maxlength"
    - Defines the maximum string length that
        - The user can enter into an <input> or <textarea> element

    - It MUST have an integer value of 0 or higher

    - Reference (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/maxlength)


- The HTML attribute "min"
    - Defines the minimum value that is acceptable & valid for
        - The input containing the attribute

    - If the value of the element is LESS than
        - The element FAILS validation
        - The value MUST be less than or equal to the value of the attribute "max"

    - Reference (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/min)


- The HTML attribute "max"
    - Defines the maximum value that is acceptable & valid for
        - The input containing the attribute

    - If the value of the element is GREATER than
        - The element FAILS validation
        - The value MUST be greater than or equal to the value of the attribute "min"

    - If the attribute "max"is present but is not specified or is invalid
        - NO "max" value is applied

    - Reference (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/max)


- The HTML attribute "pattern"
    - Specifies a regular expression that 
        - The HTML form control's value SHOULD MATCH

    - If a non-null value does NOT conform to the constraints
        - Set by the value assigned to the attribute "pattern"
        - Then the "ValidityState" object's property "patternMismatch" will be true

    - The <input> element with an attribute "type" set to "email"
        - It comes with a built-in pattern-matching validation
        - Requiring an "@" symbol and a trailing text afterwards

    - The <input> element with an attribute "type" set to "url"
        - It comes with a built-in pattern-matching validation
