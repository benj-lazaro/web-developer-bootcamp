--------------------------------
- Take what was learned about Flexbox and Media queries
    - To build a simple responsive pricing table (or panel)
        - The price tiers are arranged in a row
    
    - On a mobile device viewport

- The first thing to implement
    - A CSS Reset on the website's stylesheet

    - The goal is to normalize how styles work
        - Accross different browsers

    - It basically provide a "clean slate" to work on
        - Removing (or resetting) a browser's default (built-in) styles
            - e.g. font-size, margin, padding, etc. of elements

    - Copy and paste Meyerweb's CSS Reset code 
        - Into the start code's stylesheet (app.css)
        - Save the changes
