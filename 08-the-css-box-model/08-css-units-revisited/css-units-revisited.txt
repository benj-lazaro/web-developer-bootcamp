CSS Units Revisited
-------------------
- Focuses on the Relative units
    - These units are commonly used
        - e.g. em, rem, vh, vw, %
    
    - Reference (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Styling_basics/Values_and_units)
    

- The % (percentage) unit
    - This unit is ALWAYS set relative to some other value 
        - Sometimes a value from the parent element
        - Other times a value from the element itself (e.g. font-size)

    - It is a % of something (i.e. a property)
        - It is dependent on what that "something" is

    - When a parent element changes its current size
        - The % unit will adapt to the changes

    - Commonly used on properties such as "height" and "width"


- NOTE: To convert percentage (%) to pixels (px)
    - <percentage_value>% * <parent_pixel_value>px / 100 = <percentage_in_pixel_value>px
