CSS Units: rems
---------------
- The rem unit is similar to em where it is relative to some other value
    - HOWEVER, it is easier to work with than em


- A common issue when working with em
    - Working with nested element

    - As it nests further, the "font-size" of each nested element
        - Either grows or shrinks very quickly
    
    - Due to being dependent on the "font-size" property
        - Of the CLOSEST parent element
    

- The rem unit (root ems) is relative to the "font-size" property 
    - Of the root <html> element

    - It is relative to one "font-size" property 
        - For the entire HTML document
        - It serves as a "constant" value for the entire HTML document

    - It is NOT relative to the immediate parent element
        - Employed by the em unit

    - So if the "font-size" of the <html> element is 20px
        - 1rem  = it is ALWAYS 20px (even on nested elements)
        - 2rem  = it is ALWAYS 40px (even on nested elements)
