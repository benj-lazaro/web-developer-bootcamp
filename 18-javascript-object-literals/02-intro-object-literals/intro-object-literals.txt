Introducting Object Literals
----------------------------
- Objects (like Arrays) help to store 
    - Multiple pieces of related data together in some sort of structure
    
    - It stores data in a "key-value" pairs
        - Also referred to as "properties"

        - To access a particular value from an object
            - Use the corresponding key (i.e. a label)

        - It is similar to accessing an element from an Array
            - Using the corresponding index value

    - It is basically a collection of key-value pairs (i.e. properties)
        - The order of the properties does NOT matter


Syntax:

<object_name> = {
    <key>: <value>,
    ...
    <key>: <value>
}

// To access a value using a key
let <variable_name> = <object_name>.<key>;
