Accessing Data Out of Objects
-----------------------------
- Every key (i.e. property) in an Object literal
    - Is IMPLICITLY CONVERTED into a string
        - With the exception of a key that is a Symbol


- Ways to access a value from an Object literal
    - Using the square brackets
        - Passing the key (enclosed in quotes) as an argument

            <array_name>["<key>"];

        - It allows to access keys containing special characters

        - It allows the use of an expression as key

            <array_name>["<expression_as_key>"];


        - It allows the use of a variable as key
            - NOTE: The variable name is NOT enclosed in quotes

            <array_name>[<variable_name>];


    - Using the dot syntax
        - A dot "." followed by the key 
            
            <array_name>.<key>;

        - It is faster to write & cleaner to read

        - Using something dynamic e.g. an expression or variable name as key 
            - Will NOT work & returns "undefined"

        - Keys that is a number or contains a dot somewhere (e.g. "bar.Baz")
            - Will NOT work & returns "undefined"
