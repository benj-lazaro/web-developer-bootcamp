JavaScript Numbers
------------------
- Number is a JavaScript primitive type
    - JavaScript has one (1) Number type
    
    - These includes positive / negative, whole and decimal numbers
        - Both integers & floating points are under the primitive type of Number

    - There is a point where a number (i.e. decimal number) loses its precision
        - e.g. 1.9999999999999999 is considered as 2

        - This is due to numbers get a certain amount of space in memory
            - They are NOT permitted to take up an "infinite" amount of space


- Numbers work with math operators
    - Addition          = +
    - Subtraction       = -
    - Multiplication    = *
    - Division          = /
    - Modulo            = %
    - Exponent          = **          


- Numbers follows the PEMDAS order of operations (from left to right)
    - Parenthesis
    - Exponent
    - Multiplication
    - Division
    - Addition
    - Subtraction
