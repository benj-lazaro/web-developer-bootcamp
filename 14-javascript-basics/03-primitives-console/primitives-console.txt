Primitives & The Console
------------------------
- Primitive types refer to the basic (fundamental) building blocks
    - These refer to the types of inforation that
        - JavaScript can store, handle & work with

    - Common primitive types are as follows:
        - Number
        - String
        - Boolean
        - Null
        - Undefined

    - Less commonly used primitive types are as follows:
        - BigInt
        - Symbol


- Running JavaScript code in the browser's console
    - Launch Chrome browser

    - Launch the browser's dev tools (CTRL + SHIFT + I)
        - Click the tab "Console"
        - Type code at the ">" prompt

    - NOTE: This is NOT the standard place for developer's
        - To type / write JavaScript code in a professional setting


- To clear out any pre-loaded error or messages in the console
    - Type "clear()"
    - Press ENTER
    - Returns a "undefined" message


- The JavaScript console is also referred as a REPL
    - It stands for Read, Evaluate, Print, Loop

    - What it does is that it
        - Reads the written code (i.e. user input)        
        - It evaluates the code
        - Then prints out the corresponding result
        - Loops back to display the ">" prompt
            - Awaiting for another user input

    - NOTE: This does NOT offer permanence
        - Refreshing the browser
            - Automatically clear the content of the JavaScript console

        - It offers a faster way to test JavaScript code
