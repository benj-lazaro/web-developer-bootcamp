Updating Variables
------------------
- The "=" operator is used to assigning and updating
    - A value stored in a variable


- Commonly used shortcut on updating a Number value stored in a variable
    - Prepending the mathematical operator ahead of the "=" operator  
        - e.g. score += 1, score -= 50, score *= 2, score /= 10

    - This is equavalent to:

        <variable_name> = <variable_name> <math_operator> <value>

        - e.g. score = score + 1, score = score * 2


- To increment or decrement a Number value in a variable by 1
    - Append the "++" to incrment or "--" to decrement by 1
        - At the end of a variable name
