Booleans
--------
- A primitive type that stores ONLY two (2) special values in JavaScript
    - These values are "true" or "false"
        - NOTE: MUST be written in lowercase

    - Use case
        - Performing logic or condition checks
        - Making decisions in a game


- In JavaScript, the value (and its type) assigned to a variable
    - Can be CHANGED throughout the execution of the program / script
        - EXCEPT for the variable declared using the keyword "const"

    - Doing so will NOT generate an error message

    - TypeScript (a superset of JavaScript) 
        - Prevents this 'feature" by enforcing type restrictions
