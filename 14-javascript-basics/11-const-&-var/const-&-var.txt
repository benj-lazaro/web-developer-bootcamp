const & var
-----------
- The keyword "const" declares a variable
    - Whose asisgned value will NOT CHANGE
        - Throught the execution of the program / script

    - Triggers a "TypeError: Assignment to constant variable"
        - When attempting to change the assigned value

    - Use case
        - Storing a value that is expected NOT to CHANGE throughout the program execution
        - Working with JavaScript array and object data structures


- The keyword "var" is an old way of declaring a variable
    - Whose assigned value can be CHANGED
        - Throught the execution of the program / script

    - Works similarly to the keyword "let"
        - Still supported but discouraged from using it


Syntax:

const <identifier> = <value>;

var <identifier> = <value>;
