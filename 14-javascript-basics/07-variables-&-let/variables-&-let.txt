Variables & let
---------------
- Variables are like labels for values
    - It can store a value & give it a name
        - To refer back to the value at a later time
        - Use the value to do stuff
        - Or change the value later


- This is done using the JavaScript keyword "let"
    - The value assigned to a variable is a "snapshot" in time
    - Assigned value can be updated at a later time


Syntax:

let <variable_name> = <value>;
