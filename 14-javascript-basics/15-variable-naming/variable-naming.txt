Variable Naming and Convention
------------------------------
- Hard rules in JavaScript for naming an identifier (i.e. variable name)
    - It is case-sensitive
        - Can container letters, $, _ and digits (from 0 to 9)
    
    - It can NOT start with a digit
        - Triggers a "SyntaxError: Invalid or unexpected token" when doing so   

    - It can NOT have spaces in-between

    - Reference (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Identifier)


- Best practices (common convention) for naming an identifier
    - Use camelCase for an identifier with more than one (1) word
        - Uppercase the 1st letter of the SUCEEDING word(s)
        - Keep the 1st letter of the 1st word in lowercase

        - Otheriwse, keep the entire (single word) identifier in lowercase

    - Use good, descriptive names that describes to value it (will) store
        - e.g. isUserLoggedIn, isGameOver, userHealth

    - AVOID one letter identifier
        - Brevity does NOT make the code more efficient
        - e.g. n, x, y

    - Do NOT use a sentence-long identifier either
