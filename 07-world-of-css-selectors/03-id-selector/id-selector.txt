The ID Selector
---------------
- The CSS ID selector
    - Matches an element based on the value of the element's "id" attribute
        - The "id" attribute MUST MATCH exactly the value given in the selector
       
    - The selector MUST be PREFIXED with "#"
    
    - Reference (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/ID_selectors)

    - NOTE: The value assigned to the HTML attribute "id"
        - It should ONLY be used once
    
    - Best to keep this selector to a minimum
    

Syntax:

    /* ID Selector */
    #<selector_name> {
        <property_name>: <value>;
        ...
    }
