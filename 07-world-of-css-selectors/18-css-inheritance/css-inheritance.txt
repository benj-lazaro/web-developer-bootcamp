CSS Inheritance
---------------
- Some CSS properties will be inherited by child elements
    - If NOT set on that element specifically
    
    - NOTE: It inherits from the CLOSEST parent element
    
    - Using Chrome's dev tools
        - Under the "Style" tab

        - If an element inherits its style from a parent
            - It will display "Inherited from <element>"


- NOTE: NOT every element will inherit properties of its parent element
    - e.g. <button>, <input>

    - As a workaround assign the value "inherit"
        - To the property of the aforementioned element(s)

    - There are elements that are INCAPABLE of inheriting style(s)
        - e.g. border

        - Lookup details an element in MDN (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/)
            - Search for the field labeled "Inherited"
            - See if it is assigned with a value of "yes" or "no"
