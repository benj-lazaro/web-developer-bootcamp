Specificity
-----------
- CSS specificity resolves the issue of conflicting selectors
    - That targets the same element

    - It is an algorithm used by browsers to calculate
        - How specific a given selector is

        - The more specific selector "wins" among competing selectors
            - Its corresponding styles rendered on the browser

    - Reference (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_cascade/Specificity)


- The general formula of specificity (from highest to lowest, categories from left to right):
    - ID selector
    - Class, Attribute, Pseudo-Class selectors
    - Element, Pseudo-Element selector

    - To manualy calculate for the specificity
        - Each selector type has a score or weight of 1

        - Add the score of identical selector types together
            - According to their own groupings (see above e.g. ID, Class or Element)

        - The selectors with the highest score "wins"
