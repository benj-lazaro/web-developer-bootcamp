The Adjacent & Direct Descendant Selector
-----------------------------------------
- The CSS Adjacent selector (i.e. Next-sibling combinator)
    - Uses the "+" between two selectors
    
    - Matches the 2nd selector ONLY IF it comes RIGHT AFTER the 1st selector
        - BOTH selectors are children of the SAME parent element

    - Reference (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Next-sibling_combinator)


- The CSS Direct Descendant (i.e. Child combinator)
    - Uses the ">" between two selectors

    - Matched by the 2nd selector that is a DIRECT CHILD of the 1st selector

    - Reference (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Child_combinator)
