The Class Selector
------------------
- The CSS Class selector 
    - Matches elements based on the value of their "class" attribute

    - The selector MUST be PREFIXED with "."

    - Unlike the ID selector
        - Where the defined rule(s) can ONLY be applied 
            - To a specific elements in a HTML document

        - The defined rule(s) in a Class selector is applied 
            - To multiple elements in a HTML document
            - Commonly on grouped elements with identical value on their "class" attribute

    .<selector_name> {
        <property_name>: <value>;
        ...
    }
