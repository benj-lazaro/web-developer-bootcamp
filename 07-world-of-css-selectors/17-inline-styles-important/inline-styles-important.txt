Inline Styles & Important
-------------------------
- CSS Inline styles are MORE SPECIFIC than
    - ID, Class and Element selectors

    - NOTE: NOT RECOMMENDED to use
        - Often leads to confusion


- The "!important" flag ALTERS the rules selecting declarations in CSS
    - It comes AFTER the value of a property
        - Preceded by at least one (1) space

    - Used on individual style declarations

    - It signals the browser that the tagged "!important" rule
        - Should override any other style declarations
        
        - To consider it as an EXCEPTION from the specificity model

    - NOTE: Generally NOT RECOMMENDED to use
        - Never use when writing a plugin
        
        - Never use on site-wide CSS stylesheet

        - It will throw a "wrench" on the CSS stylesheet(s)
            - Will mess things up badly

        - Use it ONLY on page-specific CSS that overrides foreign CSS 
            - From external libraries (e.g. Bootstrap, normalize.css)

        - Always look for a way to use specificity 
            - BEFORE considering "!important"
