The CSS Cascade
---------------
- The cascade refers to the ORDER of the styles are declared MATTERS
    - Cascading from the top (first) to the bottom (last) of the style sheet
        - OR onto the next stylesheet declared in the HTML document

    - The ORDER that the things (i.e. styles) are encountered
        - Will be reflected on what is rendered on the browser

    - Between two conflicting styles declared separately in a stylesheet
        - The first style will be rendered first
            - Then the latter one will be rendered next
            - Leaving the latter style to be implemented last

    - A HTML document with MORE THAN one (1) stylesheet
        - The declared styles of identifical Selectors in the latter stylesheet
            - Will OVERRIDED the declared styles of the former stylesheet

    - NOTE: Take away from this lecture is that ORDER MATTERS in CSS
        - Take note on the ORDER of the stylesheets declared in a HTML document
