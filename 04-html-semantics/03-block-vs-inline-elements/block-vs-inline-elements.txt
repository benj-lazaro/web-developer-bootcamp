Block vs Inline Elements: <div> & <span>
----------------------------------------
- Both of these elements refers to how an HTML element
    - Fits in with the flow of content in a HTML document

    - Block elements
        - HTML elements that take up a whole "block" of space
        - It pushes neighboring elements to the next line
            - e.g. <h1>...<h6>, <p>
       
    - Inline elements
        - HTML elements that fit alongside (or share space) with other elements
        - NOTE: This default behavior can be changed using CSS
            - e.g. <a>, <img>


- The <div> is also referred as the Content Division element
    - It is a generic Block element container for flow content
        - To group elements (and related content) together

    - It has NO effect on the content or layout
        - Until styled in some way using CSS

    - It should ONLY be used when NO other semantic element is appropriate
        - e.g. <article> or <nav>
