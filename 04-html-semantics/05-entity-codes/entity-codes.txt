------------
- HTML entities (or entity codes) are special codes / reserved characters in HTML
    - They are used inside a HTML document
        - The browser then renderes the entities into correct characters

    - They are used in place for difficult to type characters
        - e.g. copyright 

    - They start with an "&" and ends with a ";"
        - With the entity name or numbers embedded in-between
