------------------------
- Semantic = relating to meaning
    - Markup that pertains to the meaning of the content of an (HTML) element


- HTML is the technology that
    - Defines the content & structure of any website

    - It should define the semantics (i.e. meaning) of the content in a machine-readable way
    
    - This is vital for
        - Accessibility (for screen readers)
        - Browser features for content to work optimally
        - Search Engine Optimization
                

- Instead of just using <div> elements to group content
    - Better to use elements such as <main>, <header>, <footer>, <nav>, <section>, <article>
        - These elements ONLY add meaning to the markup

    - They behave EXACTLY like a <div> EXCEPT
        - Each use a different name 
        
        - Each conveys a different meaning to the markup
            - In relation to the content
