Indices & Length
----------------
- Strings are indexed
    - Each character has a corresponding index number associated with it
        - Index number = positional number

    - Starting with the index value of 0
        - Index increments from left to right

    - Individual index can be accessed
        - Wrapping the index value within a pair of []
        - Returns the corresponding character associated with said index value

    - Accessing a non-existent index
        - Returns a primitive type of "undefined"
        - JavaScript's way of saying that there is NO corresponding value on the specified index


- Every string has a "magical" property named ".length"
    - Returns the number of character(s) the associated string has


- String values can be added together using the operator "+"
    - This action is referred as "string concatenation"
        - Returns a new string value

    - NOTE: Using the "+" operator between a Number and a String value
        - Returns a string value
        - JavaScript coerce the values to a common type


Syntax:

<string_value>[<index_number>];

<string_value>.length;

let variable = <string_value> + <string_value>;
