Introducing Strings
-------------------
- The JavaScript primitive type String
    - It represents textual information
        - Can be a zero to single character or very long series of characters

    - It MUST be wrapped within a pair of quotes
        - Either a pair of double or single quotes
            - As long as it remains consistent throughout the codebase
            - NEVER switch from double to single (or vice versa) on a single string

        - It is possible use a single / double quotes within a pair of quotes
            - As long as the starting & ending quotes are the same
            - e.g. "I'm doing well", 'I said "stop" in the name of love'
