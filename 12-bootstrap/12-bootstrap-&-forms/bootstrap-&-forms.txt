Bootstrap & Forms 
-----------------
- The class "form-control"
    - Often placed on the HTML element <input>
        - Returns a nicely rendered form <input> element

    - Or on the HTML element <select>


- The class "form-group"
    - Groups together <label> and <input> elements


- The class "form-control-lg" and "form-control-sm"
    - Enables HTML element <input> larger or smaller, respectively


- The class "form-check"
    - Checkbox and radio buttons that are immediate siblings
        - Will be vertically stacked and spaced

    - Uses browser-default checkbox and radio buttons


- For custom checkbox and radio button, respectively
    - Use classes "custom-control custom-checkbox"
        - Reference (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.6/components/forms/#checkboxes)

    - Use classes "custom-control custom-radio"
        - Reference (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.6/components/forms/#radios)


- For custom switches
    - Use classes "custom-control custom-switch"
        - Reference (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.6/components/forms/#switches)


- To place form elements on the same row
    - Place involved elements as a child to a HTML element <div> with the class of "row"

    - Each element with a class of "form-group"
        - Add a new class of "col"

    - Alternatively, class "form-row" can also be used
        - Similar to the previous solution
        - Renders compact elements, different gutter szie
