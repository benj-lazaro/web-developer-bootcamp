- Bootstrap sets the basic global display, typography and links
    - Reference (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.6/content/typography/)


- The Display Heading classes (e.g. "display-1" to "display-4")
    - Make large header elements that stands out
        - Offers a larger, more opinionated heading style
        - NOTE: By default, these classes are NOT responsive

    - They have NO SEMANTIC meaning
        - Does NOT REQUIRE to be in-sequence of each other


- The class "lead"
    - Makes the content of a <p> element stands out
        - Renders the content with a slightly larger font size & weight

    - Common use case:
        - A tagline
        - A lead text of a page

    
- The class "blockquote"
    - For quoting blocks of content from another source within the HTML document
        - Implemented with the HTML element <blockquote>

    - To name / identify the source material
        - Use the class "blockquote-footer"
        - Implemented with the HTML element <footer>

        - Renders a grayed out content and appends a "--" character


- The Text Alignment classes (e.g. "text-left", "text-center", "text-right")
    - Changes the alignment of an element's text content


- The Color utility classes (e.g. "text-primary", "bg-primary", "bg-gradient-primary etc.)
    - Conveys meaning through color 

    - NOTE: These ONLY provide visual indication
        - Can NOT convery meaning to users of assistive technologies (i.e. screen readers)
        - Ensure that information denoted by color is OBVIOUS from the content
