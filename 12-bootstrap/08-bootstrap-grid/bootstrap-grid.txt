Intro to the Bootstrap Grid
---------------------------
- Bootstrap's grid system uses a series of containers, rows & columns
    - To layout and align content
        - Built with Flexbox & is fully responsive

    - NOTE: It ONLY WORKS inside a Bootstrap "container"
        - A "container-fluid" (i.e. full-width container) can also be used
        - Containers can also be NESTED

    - Reference (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.6/layout/grid/)


- To create a row in Bootstrap Grid
    - Use the class "row"
    - NOTE: Every row has a TOTAL of 12 units of space across the screen
        - To be divided into columns


- To create a column
    - Use the class "col" followed by
        - Intended size (e.g. "-sm", "-md", "-lg") 
        - Number of columns (e.g. "-4", "-2")

    - NOTE: Using the class "col" ONLY
        - NOT specifying the size or number of columns
            - Results to equally sized columns in a row

        - It automatically figures out how much space each one (i.e. column) needs
