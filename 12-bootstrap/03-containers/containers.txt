Including Bootstrap & Containers 
--------------------------------
- Two ways to setup Bootstrap in a HTML document
    - Download the file 
        - Then "link" the Bootstrap file to the HTML document
            - Using the <link> element
            - NOTE: Applicable for a REAL-WORLD production deployment

    - Use CDN (Content Delivery Network)
        - Essentially a hosted version of a stylesheet
            - Accessed remotely
            - NO need to locally download the file

        <link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.5/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet" integrity="sha384-SgOJa3DmI69IUzQ2PVdRZhwQ+dy64/BUtbMJw1MZ8t5HZApcHrRKUc4W0kG879m7" crossorigin="anonymous">

        - Paste it as a child of the <head> element
            - Right above your custom stylesheet (.css)

        - To prevent your custom stylesheet rules 
            - From overriding Bootstrap's rules

    - NOTE: Most of Bootstrap's components require JavaScript to function
        - Copy the CDN URL of the corresponding script(s)

        <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.5/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js" integrity="sha384-k6d4wzSIapyDyv1kpU366/PK5hCdSbCRGRCMv+eplOQJWyd1fbcAu9OCUj5zNLiq" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>

        - Paste it as a child of the <body> element


- A Container is the most basic layout element in Bootstrap
    - It is REQUIRED when using Bootstrap's Grid System

    - It contains, pads & (sometimes) center the content within them

    - The class "container" is a responsive, fixed-width container
        - The property "max-width" changes at EACH (pre-defined) breakpoint
        - NOTE: A full-width container on small screen devices

    - The class "container-fluid" is a full-width container
        - The content spans across the entire viewport

    - The responsive container (e.g. "container-sm", "container-md", etc.)
        - It is a full-width container UNTIL it hits a specific (pre-defined) breakpoint

        - It starts like a class "container-fluid" 
            - That is UNTIL it hits a set breakpoint 
            - Then shifts behaving like a class "container"
