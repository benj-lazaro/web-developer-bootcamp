Responsive Bootstrap Grid
-------------------------
- Responsive layouts hinges upon Bootstrap's pre-defined breakpoints (e.g. "sm", "md", etc.)
    - Using classes such as 
        - "col-<units>"
        - "col-<breakpoint>"
        - "col-<breakpoint>-<units>"

- To implement responsive images
    - Use the class "img-fluid"
        - It scales an image based upon the size of its containing element

    - NOTE: The class "no-gutters"
        - Removes the space on both (left & right) sides of an image
        - Applied on "row" containers
