flex-basis, grow & shrink
-------------------------
- The CSS property "flex-basis" defines the initial size of an item in a container
    - BEFORE it is added into the flex container along the Main axis

    - It accepts a value of:
        - number (%, px, em, rem)
        - number (unit less)
        - keyword ("auto")

    - It OVERRIDES the flex item's CSS property 
        - "width" if the container's "flex-direction: row"
        - "height" if the container's "flex-container: column"

    - Reference (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex-basis)


- The CSS property "flex-grow" defines the growth factor of an item in a flex container
    - It controls the amount of available space an item could take up
        - ONLY IF there is SPACE AVAILABLE
    
    - It accepts a "unit less" number value
        - Negative values are INVALID
        - Defaults to 0

    - An item with a higher "flex-grow" value
        - It will consume more of the available space
        - Than the item with a lower number value

    - Reference (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex-grow)


- The CSS property "flex-shrink" defines the shrink factor of an item in a flex container
    - It governs the rate an item shrink when
        - There is NOT ENOUGH SPACE available in a flex container

    - If an item is LARGER THAN the flex container
        - It shrinks accordingly to the "flex-shrink" value

    - It accepts a "unit less" number value
        - Negative values are INVALID
        - Defaults to 1

    - An item with a higher "flex-shrink" value
        - It will consume less of the available space
        - Relative to those items with a lower number value

    - The value of "0" will NOT shrink the targeted item in a flex container

- The CSS property "min-width" set the minimum width of an element
    - Or item in a flex container
