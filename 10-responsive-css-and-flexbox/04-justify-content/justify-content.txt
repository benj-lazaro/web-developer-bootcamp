justify-content
---------------
- The CSS property "justify-content" determines
    - How items of a flex container are distributed along the Main axis
    - Reference (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/justify-content)


- The start edge of a flex container is dependent on the value of "flex-direction"
    - The "flex-direction" of "row"
        - Main axis starts at the left of the container

    - The "flex-direction" of "row-reverse"
        - Main axis starts at the right of the container

    - The "flex-direction" of "column"
        - Main axis starts at the top of the container

    - The "flex-direction" of "column-reverse"
        - Main axis starts at the bottom of the container

    - NOTE: CSS property "flex-direction" IMPACTS the behavior of "justify-content"


- The CSS property "justify-content" values:
    - "flex-start" (default)
        - Items packed flush to each other
        - Moved towards the start of the Main axis

    - "flex-end"
        - Items packed flush to each other
        - Moved towards the end of the Main axis

    - "center"
        - Items packed flush to each other
        - Moved towards the center of the Main axis

    - "space-between"
        - The space is evenly distributed between the items        
        - First item    = flushed to the start of the Main axis
        - Last item     = flushed to the end of the Main axis

    - "space-around"
        - Each item has the same amount of space around it 

        - Space BEFORE the first and last items
            - EQUALS to HALF of the space between adjacent items

    - "space-evenly"
        - Ensures the space between every element
            - And between the elements and the container
