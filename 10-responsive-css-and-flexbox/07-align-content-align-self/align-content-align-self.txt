align-content & align-self
-------------------------- 
- The CSS property "align-content" sets the distribution of space along the Cross axis
    - ONLY when the flex container has multiple columns or rows
    - NO effect on single-line flex containers (e.g. "flex-wrap: nowrap")

    - "flex-start" (default)
        - Move items in the container towards the start edge of the Cross axis

    - "flex-end"
        - Move items in the container towards the end edge of the Cross axis

    - "center"
        - Center items in the container at the center of the Cross axis

    - "space-between"
        - Space is evenly distributed between items along the Cross axis
        - Items are flushed towards the start & end edge of the Cross axis

    - "space-around"
        - Each item in the container has the same amount of space around it

        - The space BEFORE the first and last item is EQUAL to the HALF
            - of the space between adjacent items along the Cross axis

    - "space-evenly"
        - Ensure space between each item
            - As well between the container and the items along the Cross axis

- The CSS property "align-self" aligns an individual item along the Cross axis
    - This applies ONLY to individual items in a flex container
        - NOT to the flex container itlself
    
    - It is similar to the CSS property "align-items"
        - Except that it position one item (at a time) along the Cross axis

    - "flex-start"
        - Align an item to be flush with the start edge of the Cross axis

    - "flex-end"
        - Aligns an item to be flush with the end edge of the Cross axis

    - "center"
        - Centers an item at the middle of the Cross axis
