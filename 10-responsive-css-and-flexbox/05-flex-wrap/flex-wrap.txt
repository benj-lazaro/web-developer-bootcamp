flex-wrap
---------
- The CSS property "flex-wrap" determines whether items along the Main axis
    - Are going going to wrap onto:
        - A new line if the Main axis is horizontal
            - CSS property "flex-direction" is "row"

        - A new column if the Main axis is vertical
            - CSS property "flex-direction" is "column"

    - This property dictates the flow of a container's Cross axis
    
    - Reference (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex-wrap)


- Assigned values:
    - "nowrap" (default)
        - NO wrapping of items along the container's Main axis

    - "wrap"
        - Wraps the items along the Main axis onto a new line or column
            - Dependent on the assigned value of "flex-direction"

    - "wrap-reverse"
        - Wraps the items along the Main axis
        - Reverses the flow of the Cross axis


- NOTE: The flow of both Main and Cross axis
    - Are dependent on the assigned value of "flex-direction"

    - "flex-direction" of "row"
        - Main axis     = left to right
        - Cross axis    = top to bottom
        
    - "flex-direction" of "column"
        - Main axis     = top to bottom
        - Cross axis    = left to right
