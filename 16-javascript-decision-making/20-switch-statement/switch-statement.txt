Switch Statement Is A Lot
-------------------------
- It is another control flow statement that
    - Can replace multiple "if" statements


- It uses the keyword "switch" followed by an expression enclosed within a pair of ( )
    - Expression is evaluated
        - Then matches the expression's value against a series of "case" clauses
    
    - Executes the corresponding statement(s) of the matching "case" clauses
        - Until a "break" statement is encountered

    - If NO match is found, the statement in the "default" clause will be executed

    - Reference (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/switch)


Syntax:

switch (<expression>) {
  case <caseExpression1>:
    <statements>
    break;
  case <caseExpression2>:
    <statements>
    break;
  // â€¦
  case <caseExpressionN>:
    <statements>
    break;
  default:
    <statements>
}
