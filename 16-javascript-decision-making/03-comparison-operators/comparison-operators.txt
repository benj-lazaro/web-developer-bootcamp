Comparison Operators
--------------------
- JavaScript's comparison operators
    - Greater than              >
    - Less than                 <
    - Greater than or equal to  >=
    - Less than or equal to     <=
    - Equality                  ==
    - NOT equal                 !=
    - Strict equality           ===
    - Strict non-equality       !==


- These operators commonly work with numbers
    - Returns a boolean value

    - They can also work with strings
        - Wherein each character has its corresponding Unicode value
        - Unicode = numeric value

    - JavaScript looks at the Unicode of a character
        - When working with comparison operators
        - NOT by the character's position in the alphabet
