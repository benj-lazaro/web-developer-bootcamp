Running JavaScript From A Script
--------------------------------
- Running JavaScript code from a separate file
    - Using the HTML element <script>

    - The HTML attribute "src"
        - Assign a path to a separate script file
        - The script with the filename extension of ".js"
    
    - Calls the external JavaScript file 
        - From inside an HTML document

    - It is ideally placed 
        - At the very end of the HTML element <body>
        - Particularly if the JavaScript code interacts with HTML elements

    - Reference (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/script)
