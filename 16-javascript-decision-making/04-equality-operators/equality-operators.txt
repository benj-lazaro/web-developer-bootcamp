Equality: Triple vs Double Equals
---------------------------------
- The comparison operators that deals with equality
    - Equality (==)
        - Checks for the equality of values, NOT the type

        - JavaScript coerces BOTH values (if different) to the same type
            - Then compare for equality
            - NOTE: This can lead to unexpected results


    - Non-Equality (!=)
        - Checks for the non-equality of values, NOT the type

        - JavaScript coerces BOTH values (if different) to the same type
            - Then compare for non-equality
            - NOTE: This can lead to unexpected results


    - Strict Equality (===) 
        - Checks for equality of BOTH type and value


    - Strict Non-Equality (!==)
        - Checks for non-equality of BOTH type and value


    - IMPORTANT: Use either Strict Equality & Non-Equality for comparing values
        - To see if values are equal or non-equal

        - These operators prevent unexpected comparison results from happening
