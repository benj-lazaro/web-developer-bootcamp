Logical OR
----------
- Logical OR requires one of the expressions to be true
    - In order for the entire expression to be true

    - If BOTH the expressions are false
        - The entire expression is false

    - NOTE: When both logical AND & OR are on the same statement
        - Logical AND gets evaluated first before the logical OR
