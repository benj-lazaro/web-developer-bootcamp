Reference Types & Equality Checking
-----------------------------------
- When using the "===" or "==" operator between two arrays
    - It will ALWAYS yield a boolean "false"
        - Despite both arrays contain identical number & type of elements

    - JavaScript's "===" or "==" operators compare
        - Each array's own address (i.e. reference) in memory
        - NOT the arrays' contents (i.e. elements)
    
    - When a new array is created / declared
        - JavaScript assigns a unique address (i.e. reference)
        - In order to store associated elements of the array

    - Common use case
        - To check if variables are references the same array
        - NOT to check the array's elements

    - In order to yield a boolean "true" using "===" or "==" operators
        - Create a new array
            - Assign it as value to a variable

        - Create another variable
            - Assign the previous variable as value
        
        - In doing so
            - Both variables references the same array

        - NOTE: Any changes made in the array
            - Will be reflected on both variables
            - As both of them references the same array
