Arrays + Const
--------------
- Reason why "const" is used when declaring a variable that holds an array
    - The variable holds the reference (address) where the array is located in memory
        - It does NOT hold the content of the array
        - Think of it as referencing to a container where the array's element(s) is/are stored
        
        - Unlike assigning a primitive value to a variable
            - Where it stores the actual value
            - Where it has a finite amount of space in memory

    - This prevents a variable from being re-assigned 
        - With a reference of a brand-new array
            - Even if their contents (elements) are identical

        - Doing so, JavaScript will flag an error
            - "Uncaught TypeError: Assignment to constant variable"

    - Despite the variable being a "constant"
        - The associated array can add / remove elements
        - JavaScript will NOT flag an error
