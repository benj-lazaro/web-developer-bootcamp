CSS Transitions
---------------
- The CSS property "transition" is a shorthand for the following properties:
    - "transition-property"
    - "transition-duration"
    - "transition-timing-function"
    - "transition-delay"
    - "transition-behavior"

    - It animates the transition of one property
        - To another property value
    
    - It enables to define the transition between two states of an element
        - Different states may be defined using pseudo-classes (e.g. ":hover")
            - Or dynamically set using JavaScript

    - NOTE: To specify all properties to transition
        - Use "all" to refer & transition said properties
