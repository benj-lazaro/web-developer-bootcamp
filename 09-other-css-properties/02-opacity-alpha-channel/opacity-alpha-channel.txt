Opacity & Alpha Channel
-----------------------
- The alpha value represents a value that is either a number or percentage
    - Specifying the alpha channel or transparency of a color
        - How "see through" is the color

    - The assigned value could be
        - From decimal 0 (fully transparent) to 1.0 (fully opaque)
        - From 0% (fully transparent) to 100% (fully opaque)

    - NOTE: This does NOT affect the transparency of the element's text content
        - ONLY the color

    - NOTE: When using a hex value for color
        - The last 2 (two) hex digits represents the alpha channel

- The CSS property "opacity" sets the opacity of an element
    - Opacity is the degree to which content behind an element is hidden
        - Basically, the opposite of transparency

    - It affects the opacity of the ENTIRE element
        - Including its contents and descendants

    - The assigned value is
        - From decimal 0 (fully transparent) to 1 (fully opaque)
