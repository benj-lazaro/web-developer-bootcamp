The Position Property
---------------------
- The CSS property "position" sets how an element is position in a HTML document
    - The properties "top", "right", "bottom" & "left" determines the final location

    - The assigned values are as follows:
        - "static"
            - The element is positioned according to the normal flow of the document
            - Using properties "top", "right", "bottom" & "left" has NO effect

        - "relative"
            - The element is positioned according to the normal flow of the document
            - Then offset relative to itself based on the properties "top", "right", "bottom" & "left"
            - The previous space left behind by the element is still present

        - "absolute"
            - The element is REMOVED from the normal flow of the document
            - NO space is created for the element in the page layout
            - Positioned relative to its CLOSEST POSITIONED ancestor (other than "static") 
                - Or initial containing block (i.e. <body>)
            - Final position determined by the properties "top", "right", "bottom" & "left"

        - "fixed"
            - The element is REMOVED from the normal flow of the document
            - NO space is created for the element in the page layout
            - Positioned relative to its initial containing block (i.e. viewport)
                - Unlike "absolute" it is NOT dependent on an ancestor / parent element
            - Final position determined by the properties "top", "right", "bottom" & "left"
            - NOTE: Often used for navigation bar

        - "sticky"
            - The element is positioned according to the normal flow of the document
            - Then offset relative to its nearest SCROLLING ancestor & containing block
                - Based on the values of the properties "top", "right", "bottom" & "left"
