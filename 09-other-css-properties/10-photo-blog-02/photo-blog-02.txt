Photo Blog Code Along Part 02
-----------------------------
- Focuses on the <nav> element of the project


- The <img> elements in the starter code's HTML document
    - Are intentionally close together
        - Instead of each <img> element having their own separate line

    - This is to eliminate a whitespace character
        - Being automatically embedded in-between each <img> element
        - As each whitespace character has its own width

    - HTML INSERTS a whitespace character in-between inline elements
        - That are separated by a newline
        - Inline elements = <span>, <img>, etc.

    - HTML does NOT INSERT a whitespace character in-between inline elements
        - If the SHARE the same line

    - NOTE: This is a well-known, obnoxious behavior of HTML
        - Using Flexbox eliminates this behavior
