Photo Blog Code Along Part 01
-----------------------------
- Build a simple photographer's homepage
    - Implementing recent lessons learned

    - Use the attached starter code (photosite.html)


- For setting the property "margin" of the images
    - By manually calculating it
        - Finding out how to distribute the remaining value around each image in a row

    - Identify the number of images to be rendered in a single row
        - Get the sum of the images' property "width"
        - Subtract the sum with the 100% space of the HTML document
        - Take note of the difference
    
    - Get the total number of sides for each image on the same row
        - Take into account the left & right side of each margin

        - Divide the difference with the total number of sides

        - The result will be the value assigned
            - For the property "margin" of each image


- Alternatively
    - Assign the function value "calc()" to the property "margin" of the images

    - Pass the expression as argument value to "calc()"
        - <difference> / <total_number_of_left_right_sides_of_images>
        - e.g. calc(10%/g)

    - Calculates and assigns the result to the property "margin"

    - NOTE: This presents a better option
        - It presents the logic / mathematical expression behind the assigned value
